SCAM is a second-order optimization algorithm that aims to minimize the loss function by explicitly taking the curvature of the loss function into account. The algorithm operates by keeping track of a running average of the Hessian matrix of the loss function, which is used to adjust the learning rate at each iteration. Specifically, the learning rate is adjusted based on the ratio of the diagonal of the Hessian matrix to its trace.

To implement SCAM in PyTorch using torch.optim, you would need to create a new optimizer class that inherits from the base Optimizer class in torch.optim. You would define the optimization step using the SCAM update rule to adjust the learning rate based on the curvature of the loss function.

Here's some pseudocode to illustrate how you could implement the update rule for SCAM in PyTorch using the torch.Tensor and torch.optim frameworks:

```
from torch.optim import Optimizer

class SCAM(Optimizer):
    def __init__(self, params, lr=1e-3):
        super(SCAM, self).__init__(params, defaults)
        self.lr = lr
        self.avg_H = None

    def step(self, closure=None):
        if closure is not None:
            loss = closure()

        if self.avg_H is None:
            self.avg_H = torch.zeros((len(list(self.param_groups[0]['params'])), len(list(self.param_groups[0]['params'])))).to(device) # Initialize the running average of the Hessian matrix.

        gradients = []
        for param in self.param_groups[0]['params']:
            gradients.append(param.grad.flatten())
        gradients = torch.cat(gradients)

        H = torch.autograd.functional.hessian(closure, self.param_groups[0]['params'], create_graph=True) # Compute the Hessian matrix of the loss function.

        if self.avg_H is None:
            self.avg_H = H
        else:
            self.avg_H = 0.5 * (self.avg_H + H) # Update the running average of the Hessian matrix using a decay factor.

        H_diag = torch.diag_embed(torch.diagonal(H, dim1=-2, dim2=-1)) # Compute the diagonal elements of the Hessian matrix.

        lr = self.lr * (torch.diagonal(H, dim1=-2, dim2=-1) / torch.trace(H))[0] # Compute the SCAM learning rate using the diagonal and trace of the Hessian matrix.

        update = - torch.inverse(self.avg_H + H_diag) @ gradients # Compute the update using the SCAM update rule.

        i = 0
        for param in self.param_groups[0]['params']:
            param.data.add_(lr[i] * update[i:(i+param.numel())].reshape(param.shape))
            i += param.numel()

        return loss
```

This is just a sketch and should be adjusted and tested to make sure it works properly.
